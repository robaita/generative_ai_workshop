# Finetune LLM for Custom Dataset
Fine-tuning in large language models (LLMs) involves taking a pre-trained model and adapting it to perform better on a specific task or dataset. Fine-tuning is often necessary when you want the LLM to specialize or align with a particular use case, such as responding to customer queries in a specific industry or understanding highly technical jargon. This process is generally more efficient than training an LLM from scratch, as it leverages the vast knowledge and patterns learned during the pre-training phase, only adjusting model parameters where needed to improve performance on the target task.

## Example of Fine-Tuning an LLM
Suppose we have an LLM, like LLAMA series models, that has been trained on a vast corpus of general internet text. We want to adapt this model for use in a customer support chatbot for a telecommunications company. To make the model effective in handling customer queries specific to telecom services, we would fine-tune it on a dataset composed of transcripts, FAQs, or customer service interactions specific to that domain.

### The fine-tuning process involves:
> **Dataset Preparation:** Curate a dataset with telecom-related dialogues or FAQs.   
> **Training:** Adjust the model's weights on this new dataset, which allows it to prioritize responses based on telecom knowledge.  
> **Evaluation:** Assess the model's performance on telecom-related queries to ensure it provides accurate, relevant answers.  


Through this process, the model becomes better at understanding and generating responses aligned with telecom-specific queries, while still retaining its general language capabilities.

## What is LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a technique for fine-tuning large language models in a more computationally efficient and storage-friendly way. LoRA specifically focuses on reducing the number of parameters required for fine-tuning by representing model weight changes in a low-rank form.    

In traditional fine-tuning, all model parameters are adjusted, which can be computationally costly, especially for very large models. LoRA addresses this by applying updates only to low-rank matrices, which are much smaller and therefore require significantly less computational power and memory.   

Here’s how LoRA works in practice:   

> **1. Freeze the Pre-trained Model Weights:** Instead of adjusting all parameters of the LLM, LoRA freezes the core weights and introduces additional low-rank matrices (small adjustments).    
> **2. Train Only the Low-Rank Matrices:** During fine-tuning, only these low-rank matrices are updated based on the new dataset. This reduces the overall number of parameters that need to be modified.    
> **3. Efficient Deployment:** At runtime, the original model weights and the low-rank matrices are combined to produce the adapted model, which retains the model’s performance for specific tasks but requires far fewer resources.

### Example of LoRA Fine-Tuning
Consider you have an LLM like LLAMA 3.2 with billions of parameters. Fine-tuning it for a task, such as medical advice generation, could be expensive. Using LoRA, you’d only adjust low-rank matrices that capture relevant medical knowledge while keeping the rest of the model unchanged. This drastically reduces the computational and storage costs associated with fine-tuning while still tailoring the LLM effectively for the specialized task.
